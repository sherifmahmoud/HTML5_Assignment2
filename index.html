				<td><p><strong>Trigonometry</strong> (from Greek trig≈çnon "triangle" + metron "measure") is a branch of mathematics that studies triangles and the relationships between the lengths of their sides and the angles between those sides.
			Trigonometry defines the trigonometric functions, which describe those relationships and have applicability to cyclical phenomena, such as waves. 
			The field evolved during the third century BC as a branch of geometry used extensively for astronomical studies. It is also the foundation of the practical art of surveying. <strong>-From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</strong></p></td>
